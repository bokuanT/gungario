## About the Project
**Motivation**

As we grew up in the age of the explosion of the internet, we were no strangers to technology. Many of our first memorable experiences with technology were video games, making them inevitably a large part of our childhood. Be it Flash games on web browsers, Facebook web games, any first person shooter out of the innumerable titles available on a plethora of digital game distribution services or more recently, the myriads of mobile games readily accessible with our smartphones. Gaming has always been our passion, and now that we’ve been equipped with relevant skills from various CS modules, game development seemed like the only logical step.

Apart from our great zeal in making a game, we feel we can put to use what we have learnt in the past two short, but invaluable semesters. We will inevitably showcase our proficiency in OOP from CS2030s in game-making. The extensive number of algorithms and data structures that we have learnt in CS2040s will aid us in implementing an efficient matchmaking service in our game.


**Aim**

We hope to make a 2D online multiplayer shooter game. Players will have their own accounts. Being a multiplayer game, we will have to implement an efficient matchmaking system.

**User Stories**
1. As a gamer with little time to spare, I want to be able to matchmake a game quickly so I can maximize my time playing. (Fast Queue System)
 
2. As a gamer who likes to customize and work on the same character, I want to have an account on which I can play the same character. (Personal Accounts) 

3. As a gamer hanging out with a group of friends, I want to be able to play in the same room as all of them. (Private Lobbies)

**Features**
Features to be completed by the mid of June: 

1. Client rendering
Create or find all assets (graphics and sound), make what needs to be seen show up on the screen.

2. Client input 
Make our game interactive and playable by having the game respond to user inputs.

Features to be completed by the mid of July: 

1. Implement server-side logic
Manages players and simulates the game with its update loop. Manages logic for game Objects and their collisions.

2. Allow unique accounts with our backend 
Accounts should store users’ own data such as the in-game cosmetics they own (skins), their level and so on.

3. Optimize client state 
Ensure the user does not experience delays when playing in the multiplayer mode.
